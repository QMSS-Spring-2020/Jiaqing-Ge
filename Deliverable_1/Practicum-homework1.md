In this graph, I plot a graph showing the number of complaints through out a year to see whether there are more complaints in certain months or day. We can see from the graph that there are a few outliars that are very low appears at the beginning of the month. On Jan-01, Mar-01, Jul-01 and Sep-01, the number of complaints drops significantly. 

### Ploting number of complaints of certain complany through out the year through out the year

```r
simpleCap <- function(x) {
  s <- strsplit(x, " ")[[1]]
  paste(toupper(substring(s, 1,1)), substring(s, 2),
      sep="", collapse=" ")
} # This line change the format of company names
complaints_pattern_company <- function(x){ 
p_ <-  complaints_test %>% 
  filter(Company == x)  %>%
  mutate(date = as.POSIXct(paste(month , day , sep = "." )  , format = "%m.%d" )) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(number_of_complaints = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = number_of_complaints))+ geom_point()+ylab("Number of complaints")+
  theme_economist()+
  scale_x_datetime(labels=  date_format("%b-%d"),date_breaks = '1 month')+
  geom_smooth(lwd=1, se=FALSE,color = 'red')+
  geom_line(aes(x=date, y=SMA(number_of_complaints,10), color = 'red'))+ 
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  ggtitle(paste("Number of Complaints throughout a Year:",simpleCap(tolower(x)), sep = ' '))
ggplotly(p_)}
